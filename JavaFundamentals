Java is a object oriented, high level, secured programming language.

----jvm, jre and jdk

jvm is java virtual machine, it physically does not exists, it provoid converts the java code to byte code which can be exicuted.
jre is a java run time environment provoids the some librabires which are required to develop java applications
and jdk is java development kit which includes all these jvm and jre, and provoid the debugger.

----Stack and heap memory
stack holds variables, faster, have the fixed sized, follw LIFO management system, stores primitive datatypes.
public void methodA() {
    int x = 10;  // x is stored in stack memory
}

Heap memory stores objects and the instance does not follow LIFO it follows shared memory pool, slower than the stack, memory managed by the garbage collector.

---- Primitive and non primitive datatypes:

primitive datatype is the builtin data types which is available in the java, that are not the objects and we can simple store the values for that.

Integer Types:

    byte: 1 byte (8-bit), range from -128 to 127.
    short: 2 bytes (16-bit), range from -32,768 to 32,767.
    int: 4 bytes (32-bit), commonly used integer type.
    long: 8 bytes (64-bit), large integer values.

Floating-Point Types:

    float: 4 bytes (32-bit), single-precision floating-point.
    double: 8 bytes (64-bit), double-precision floating-point.

Character Type:

    char: 2 bytes (16-bit), stores a single character or Unicode value.

Boolean Type:

    boolean: 1 bit (true or false), represents binary values

Non primitive datatypes is which are not builtin datatypes that referes to the objects, stores the address in the stack and holds the actual objects are in the heap memory.
